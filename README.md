# Tips how to develop front end

List of rules that we follow while creating awesome projects with high technical requirements:)

## Who is the "client"
Here we use word "client" to point out the person who own the project ("product owner" from Scrum). When you see "client" you can imagine your boss if you are the employee or your real client if you are agency manager or freelancer.

## List of rules? Really?
It is  just a list of best and worst practices that we have collected to prevent our colleagues from implicit and not obvious code. Remember, these are suggestions. Take them, use them, think about them, and change them as needed. Please, feel free to create pull-requests, write comments and fork this project :)
