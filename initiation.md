#### Check which browser we support
 By default, we support the latest versions of Chrome, Opera, Safari and Edge. But sometimes client demands the support of earlier versions

#### Check is there separate files with adaptive design
 If there are not additional requirements for adaptive, check how the app should display on different dimensions

#### Launch web-sites on http://localhost, not file:///c:\test.html
 There can be problems with `<iframe>` and cross-origin requests when web-site is on `file://` protocol
 
#### Don't stop on working decisions
 Test not only solution is working but also check how it is readable and reliable. Readability should be your first priority
