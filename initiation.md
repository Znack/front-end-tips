#### Check browser we support
 By default, we support the latest versions of Chrome, Opera, Safari and Edge. But sometimes client demands the support of earlier versions

#### Check if there are separate files with adaptive design
 If there are not additional requirements for adaptive design, check how the app will be zoomed on different displays. 
 
#### Launch websites with http://localhost, not file:///c:\test.html
 There can be problems with `<iframe>` and cross-origin requests when web-site is on `file://` protocol
 
#### Don't stop because of working decisions
 Don't only test that your solution is working but also check if it is readable and reliable. Readability must be your first priority
